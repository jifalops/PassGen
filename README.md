PassGen
=======

A simple offline password generator (chrome extension).

PassGen allows you to use different passwords for every website while only needing to remember a single password - without ever sending that password over the internet! 

Internally, PassGen uses a secure one-way hashing algorithm (SHA-256) to generate a password from both the website (pre-filled) and your secret password. 

The result: A different 16 character password for every website that contains lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and symbols (optional).
